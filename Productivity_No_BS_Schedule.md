|---------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **5:00 - 6:00 AM** | 🚀 **Morning Routine & Mental Priming** (Cold shower, meditation, journaling) | **Mental clarity, energy boost** | High-performers (Musk, Bezos) use mornings for **mental priming**. |
| **6:00 - 10:00 AM** | 🧠 **Deep Work: Buying Companies (M&A Work - Finding Deals, Due Diligence, Offers)** | **High-leverage, wealth-building work** | *Productivity: No BS* says tackle **the hardest, most valuable work first.** |
| **10:00 - 10:30 AM** | ☕ **Break & Quick Review** (Check critical emails ONLY) | **Recharge & adjust strategy** | Prevents **decision fatigue** and maintains **mental sharpness**. |
| **10:30 - 12:00 PM** | 📦 **Amazon E-Commerce Scaling (Automation, Ads, Supplier Optimization)** | **Grow passive income & automate tasks** | Use **VAs, automation, and AI** to reduce workload. |

| **3:00 - 8:00 PM** | 🏋️‍♂️ **Sports & Family Time** | **Physical & mental reset** | *Non-negotiable for long-term success* (high-performers always protect health & relationships). |

## 🔥 Execution Plan: How to Maintain Maximum Efficiency

| **Productivity Principle** | **Execution Rule** | **How It Works in Your Business** |
|---------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Prioritize Deep Work (OBT Method)** | **First 4 Hours = No Distractions, Only High-Value Work (M&A Deals)** | You make **million-dollar decisions** in the morning. No emails, no meetings. |
| **Batch & Automate** | **Amazon & Consulting = Systemized & Delegated** | Outsource **low-level Amazon work** (VAs, AI tools). Batch **consulting calls 2x per week**. |
| **Meetings = Productivity Killers** | **Meetings only if 100% necessary** (No status updates) | *Only meetings for **decision-making** (not discussions).* |
| **Emails = Strict Limits** | **Check email ONLY twice per day (10:00 AM & 8:00 PM)** | Prevents **constant task switching & distraction loops**. |
| **Physical & Mental Reset** | **Sports & Family = Mandatory** | *You perform better when your body & mind are optimized.* |
| **Weekly Adjustment** | **Sunday = 30-Minute Weekly Review** (What worked? What wasted time? What to improve?) | Keeps you **on track, adjusting what doesn’t work.** |
